## This is my website.
 It's an introduction to what I do and a brief description about myself.
 The website is built using **_Foundation Framework_** with a 12-grid layout to achieve responsiveness.
 **HTML** **CSS** and **JAVASCRIPT** was used to create and style the page. The contact Link brings up a _modal_ with a contact form.
 **JavaScript** was used to make the form functional so that visitors of the page could send there responses, leave feed back
 or just to contact me..
 Also social media links are added to the form to enable visitors check me out on the social media platforms and the phone number is for visitors who would want to contact me directly..
 
 The framework can be found at [Foundation](www.foundationzurb.com)
 The site is hosted in [Bitballoon](larrisabrians.bitballoon.com) so you can check it out over there..
